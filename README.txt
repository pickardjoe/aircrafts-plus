WARNING:
I do not recommend to use any custom mods that will replace the original builder, as those are incompatible with structures included inside the mod and may not build structures like experimental factory, where some of the units are located,builders such as: Mega Builders, MOBA Builders etc. ARE incompatible with this mod.

How to install this mod [PC]
